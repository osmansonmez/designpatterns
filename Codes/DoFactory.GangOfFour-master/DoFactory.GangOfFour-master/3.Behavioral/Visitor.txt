Definition

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Visitor pattern in which an object traverses an object structure and performs the same operation on each node in this structure. Different visitor objects define different operations.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Visitor pattern in which two objects traverse a list of Employees and performs the same operation on each Employee. The two visitor objects define different operations -- one adjusts vacation days and the other income.
