Definition

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Strategy pattern which encapsulates functionality in the form of an object. This allows clients to dynamically change algorithmic strategies.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Strategy pattern which encapsulates sorting algorithms in the form of sorting objects. This allows clients to dynamically change sorting strategies including Quicksort, Shellsort, and Mergesort.
