Definition

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Mediator pattern facilitating loosely coupled communication between different objects and object types. The mediator is a central hub through which all interaction must take place.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Mediator pattern facilitating loosely coupled communication between different Participants registering with a Chatroom. The Chatroom is the central hub through which all communication takes place. At this point only one-to-one communication is implemented in the Chatroom, but would be trivial to change to one-to-many.
