Definition

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Command pattern which stores requests as objects allowing clients to execute or playback the requests.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Command pattern used in a simple calculator with unlimited number of undo's and redo's. Note that in C#  the word 'operator' is a keyword. Prefixing it with '@' allows using it as an identifier.
