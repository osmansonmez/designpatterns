Definition

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Template method which provides a skeleton calling sequence of methods. One or more steps can be deferred to subclasses which implement these steps without changing the overall calling sequence.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates a Template method named Run() which provides a skeleton calling sequence of methods. Implementation of these steps are deferred to the CustomerDataObject subclass which implements the Connect, Select, Process, and Disconnect methods.
