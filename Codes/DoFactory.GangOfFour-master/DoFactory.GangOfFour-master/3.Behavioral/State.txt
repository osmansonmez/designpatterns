Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the State pattern which allows an object to behave differently depending on its internal state. The difference in behavior is delegated to objects that represent this state.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the State pattern which allows an Account to behave differently depending on its balance. The difference in behavior is delegated to State objects called RedState, SilverState and GoldState. These states represent overdrawn accounts, starter accounts, and accounts in good standing.
