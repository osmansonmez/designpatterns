Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern creating parallel hierarchies of objects. Object creation has been abstracted and there is no need for hard-coded class names in the client code.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the creation of different animal worlds for a computer game using different factories. Although the animals created by the Continent factories are different, the interactions among the animals remain the same.
