Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Factory method offering great flexibility in creating different objects. The Abstract class may provide a default object, but each subclass can instantiate an extended version of the object.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Factory method offering flexibility in creating different documents. The derived Document classes Report and Resume instantiate extended versions of the Document class. Here, the Factory Method is called in the constructor of the Document base class.
