Definition

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Builder pattern in which complex objects are created in a step-by-step fashion. The construction process can create different object representations and provides a high level of control over the assembly of the objects.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstates the Builder pattern in which different vehicles are assembled in a step-by-step fashion. The Shop uses VehicleBuilders to construct a variety of Vehicles in a series of sequential steps.
