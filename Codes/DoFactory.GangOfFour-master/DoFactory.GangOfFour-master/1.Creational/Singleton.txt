Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Singleton pattern which assures only a single instance (the singleton) of the class can be created.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Singleton pattern as a LoadBalancing object. Only a single instance (the singleton) of the class can be created because servers may dynamically come on- or off-line and every request must go throught the one object that has knowledge about the state of the (web) farm.

Optimized code

The .NET optimized code demonstrates the same code as above but uses more modern, built-in .NET features.

Here an elegant .NET specific solution is offered. The Singleton pattern simply uses a private constructor and a static readonly instance variable that is lazily initialized. Thread safety is guaranteed by the compiler.
