Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Bridge pattern which separates (decouples) the interface from its implementation. The implementation can evolve without changing clients which use the abstraction of the object.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Bridge pattern in which a BusinessObject abstraction is decoupled from the implementation in DataObject. The DataObject implementations can evolve dynamically without changing any clients.
