Definition

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Composite pattern which allows the creation of a tree structure in which individual nodes are accessed uniformly whether they are leaf nodes or branch (composite) nodes.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the Composite pattern used in building a graphical tree structure made up of primitive nodes (lines, circles, etc) and composite nodes (groups of drawing elements that make up more complex elements).
