Definition

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Structural code

This structural code demonstrates the Adapter pattern which maps the interface of one class onto another so that they can work together. These incompatible classes may come from different libraries or frameworks.

Real-world code

This real-world code demonstrates the use of a legacy chemical databank. Chemical compound objects access the databank through an Adapter interface.
